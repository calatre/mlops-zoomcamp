#On Linux, the quick-start needs to know your host user id and needs to have group id set to 0. Otherwise the files created in dags, logs, config and plugins will be created with root user ownership. You have to make sure to configure them for the docker-compose:
mkdir -p ./dags ./logs ./plugins ./config
echo -e "AIRFLOW_UID=$(id -u)" > .env

#Optional: initialize default configs, if you didn't provide a config file
docker compose run airflow-cli airflow config list

# Initialization Container
docker compose up airflow-init

# After all is done, you can start the Airflow services with:
# docker compose up
